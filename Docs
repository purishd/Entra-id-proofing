**Problem Statement**- Often customer's end users call their helpdesk team to fix any issue for them such us updating their user profile, password reset etc. The helpdesk team needs to verify the users and they ask the end users some of their personal information such as DOB, divers license, employee ID etc. to confirm the user's Identity. This is an Identity Proofing scenario that need not rely on pesonal information but something super simple. If somehting as simple as sending an OTP to the calling user on their mobile and ask them to verify the same back with us, then help desk don't need to necessarily need to delve into user's personal information.

# Objective: Build an application that will generate OTP and send it to user. Helpdesk can verify the user by requesting them for same OTP.
1. Build an Powerapp UI that will collect user's detail.
2. Build Powerautomate flow to send an OTP to the user
3. Record this OTP in SharePoint for verification and auditing purpose.
